The following is what a response from the api

{
    "call_id": "call_6f036563c7725baaf83680780b8",
    "call_type": "phone_call",
    "agent_id": "agent_63cbfc51dc5411750baa26b0da",
    "agent_version": 0,
    "agent_name": "Single-Prompt Agent",
    "call_status": "registered",
    "latency": {},
    "call_cost": {
        "product_costs": [],
        "total_duration_seconds": 0,
        "total_duration_unit_price": 0,
        "combined_cost": 0
    },
    "opt_out_sensitive_data_storage": false,
    "opt_in_signed_url": false,
    "from_number": "+19174733799",
    "to_number": "+19144919901",
    "direction": "outbound"
}

We should therefore not use our own uuid system, but whenever we receieve a call request, we post to
retell's api and get this information and sub in call id.

We need 2 headers.
Authorization --> bearer api key
Content type --> application/json

Body needs:
from_number: in env call
to_number: from request
retell_llm_dynamic_variables: object which contains two fields. system_prompt with the user's system prompt from their preferences
as well as task_prompt which is the user's task for the agent to complete.
